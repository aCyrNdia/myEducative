1. Virtual environment to manage packages
   - Create the virtual environment : virtualenv virt
   - Activate the virtual environment : source virt/bin/activate

2. Necessary packages in the virtual environment 
   - Install packages : pip install flask==2.0.3 Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.5.1
   - Add the packages in a requirements.txt file : pip freeze > /usercode/elearning/requirements.txt

3. Initialize the EB CLI repository : eb init -i
   - Define the Application name : flaskbeanstalk
   - # Here you can create multiple application, but the last you init is the one which will be used for the next step
   - Show the application list : aws elasticbeanstalk describe-applications

4. Create an ElasticBeanstalk environment that runs by creating a new infra : For each project initialization, an environment is created
   - Create our environment : eb create flask-env

5. Deploy the flaskbeanstlk Application
   - Notice the newly created environment domain name where the application is running : flask-env.eba-vrvipayh.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
   - Check the status of the environment : eb status flask-env
