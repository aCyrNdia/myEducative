This is where I will put my templates.
These templates are such an explanation on how to use some tools for doing somes projects

The main used tools are :
- Kubernetes when it comes to microservices,
- Flask for Python app development,
- Helm for all about infrastructure templating


For the templates, the directories
- AppModel/		: contain the model app for our serverless function with the handler and are based on Application/
- Application/		: contain the application files and the Dockerfile used to create the image based on that application or for serverless model
- InfraOnCluster/	: contain the Kubernetes objects used to deploy our cluster
- MyChart/		: contain the structure of a from scratch developed chart
